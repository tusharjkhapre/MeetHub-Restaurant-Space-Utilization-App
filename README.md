# Restaurant Space Utilization App(/restaurant-app.png)

## Description

In today's world, many restaurants face the challenge of underutilized spaces during off-peak hours, such as afternoons and weekdays. At the same time, individuals and small groups often struggle to find affordable, comfortable environments for meetings, celebrations, and work sessions without the obligation to purchase food. Our app addresses both of these issues by creating a platform that connects these two needs.

## Project Vision

Our mission is to create a win-win solution for both restaurant owners and customers. Restaurant owners can optimize their revenue by renting out their vacant spaces, while customers gain access to affordable, convenient locations for various purposes:

- **Business Meetings:** Professionals can book spaces for meetings without the distractions of a typical caf√©.
- **Social Gatherings:** Friends and families can celebrate special occasions in a private setting.
- **Workspaces:** Entrepreneurs, freelancers, and startup teams can find quiet places to work and collaborate.

## Key Features

- **Space Booking System:** Users can search for and book available restaurant spaces for specific times and dates.
- **Flexible Pricing:** Competitive pricing for off-peak hours, making it affordable for everyone.
- **Additional Services:** Options to add WiFi and charging stations if not provided by the restaurant.
- **User Profiles:** Manage bookings, view history, and receive personalized recommendations.
- **Restaurant Management:** Tools for restaurant owners to manage availability, pricing, and bookings.
